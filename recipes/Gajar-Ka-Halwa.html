          Try this recipe if you want to know how to make traditional Indian
          gajar ka halwa, or carrot halwa. A lovely dessert anytime, I most
          recently made it for Diwali. This is the 'old school' method that uses
          whole milk, not condensed milk. You can use ghee instead of oil for
          initially cooking the carrots, if desired.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
          <li>2 pounds carrots, grated</li>
          <li>1 Â½ quarts whole milk</li>
          <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook
            and stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and increase heat;
            bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce
            heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring carrot-milk mixture back to a boil. Add sugar, raisins,
            cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened,
            about 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each
            serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill before
            serving.
