          This savory Indian rice recipe is flavored with whole spices and fried
          onions. Soaking the basmati rice before cooking makes all the
          difference. Serve this Indian-style rice with your favorite Indian
          curry or dal (lentils). Make sure you warn people not to bite into the
          whole spices!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Â½ cups basmati rice</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

        <ol>
          <li>

          <li>
            Meanwhile, in the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large
            pot or saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods,
            and cloves, then stir in cumin seed. Cook and stir until fragrant
            and toasted, about a minute, then add onion to the pot. Saute onion
            until the color is a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes.

          <li>
            Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice
            until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add water and salt, and
            bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low

          <li>
            Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the water has been
            absorbed. Let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before
            serving.
